## Letʻs measure frogs! 

If you are interested in measuring morphometrics on frogs, I hope you find this project website helpful. We are collecting morphometric data on microhylid frogs from the Papuan region (subfamily Asterophryinae) using calipers.


## Getting started

Please look over the definition of the measurements and [Landmarks](landmarks.qmd) and assessing [Repeatability](repeatability.qmd). Assessing repeatability is important for morphometric analyses in general and absolutely critical when multiple investigators are taking measurements.

## Acknowledgements

This website was developed and is maintained by [Marguerite Butler](https://butlerlab.org).

Many thanks to the many people who helped:
Julio Rivera who developed the landmarks and collected an extensive dataset. Ethan Hill and Claire Fraser contributed additional data. 
Allison Fisher, Ke Cao, Diana Gao, and Kaitlyn Sato assisted with refining the landmarks.
Allison Fisher and Marguerite Butler contributed to the formal definitions of the landmarks and the landmark document.
