    "text": "General advice\n\nThese are very small frogs, begin by learning the anatomical landmarks so you know where to place the calipers.\nLearn the landmarks by making sure you can repeat known measurements on a frog.\nGenerally bones are measured end-to-end on the outer edges.\nFrogs are also squishy and not generally bony. Start with the calipers a little too wide, then bring them in until they just touch the frog at the landmarks.\nStart with clean calipers that slide easily, clean them gently with 70% EtOH if needed.\nKeep the frog specimen moist with 70% EtOH at all times. Do not let specimens dry out."
